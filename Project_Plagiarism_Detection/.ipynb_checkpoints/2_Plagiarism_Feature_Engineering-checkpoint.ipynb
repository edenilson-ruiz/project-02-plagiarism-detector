    "In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines an answer text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided, source text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create some features that can then be used to train a classification model. This task will be broken down into a few discrete steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean and pre-process the data.\n",
    "* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.\n",
    "* Select \"good\" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.\n",
    "* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _next_ notebook, Notebook 3, you'll use the features and `.csv` files you create in _this_ notebook to train a binary classification model in a SageMaker notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be defining a few different similarity features, as outlined in [this paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf), which should help you build a robust plagiarism detector!\n",

At it's heart, this task is a comparison text; one that looks at a given answer and a source text, compares them and predicts whether an answer has plagiarized from the source. To effectively do this comparison, and train a classifier we'll need to do a few more things: pre-process all of our text data and prepare the text files (in this case, the 95 answer files and 5 original source files) to be easily compared, and split our data into a `train` and `test` set that can be used to train a classifier and evaluate it, respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. A `Text` column; this holds all the lowercase text for a `File`, with extraneous punctuation removed.\n",
    "2. A `Datatype` column; this is a string value `train`, `test`, or `orig` that labels a data point as part of our train or test set\n",

The similarity features you will use are informed by [this paper on plagiarism detection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf). \n",

In the following explanations, I'll refer to a submitted text file as a **Student Answer Text (A)** and the original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Source Text (S)**.\n",

    "Your first task will be to create **containment features**. To understand containment, let's first revisit a definition of [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). An *n-gram* is a sequential word grouping. For example, in a line like \"bayes rule gives us a way to combine prior knowledge with new information,\" a 1-gram is just one word, like \"bayes.\" A 2-gram might be \"bayes rule\" and a 3-gram might be \"combine prior knowledge.\"\n",

    "If the two texts have no n-grams in common, the containment will be 0, but if _all_ their n-grams intersect then the containment will be 1. Intuitively, you can see how having longer n-gram's in common, might be an indication of cut-and-paste plagiarism. In this project, it will be up to you to decide on the appropriate `n` or several `n`'s to use in your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXERCISE: Create containment features\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `complete_df` that you've created, you should have all the information you need to compare any Student  Answer Text (A) with its appropriate Wikipedia Source Text (S). An answer for task A should be compared to the source text for task A, just as answers to tasks B, C, D, and E should be compared to the corresponding original source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll complete the function, `calculate_containment` which calculates containment based upon the following parameters:\n",
    "* A given DataFrame, `df` (which is assumed to be the `complete_df` from above)\n",
    "* An `answer_filename`, such as 'g0pB_taskd.txt' \n",
    "* An n-gram length, `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containment calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to complete this function are as follows:\n",
    "1. From *all* of the text files in a given `df`, create an array of n-gram counts; it is suggested that you use a [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) for this purpose.\n",
    "2. Get the processed answer and source texts for the given `answer_filename`.\n",

    "You should use feature correlation across the *entire* dataset to determine which features are ***too*** **highly-correlated** with each other to include both features in a single model. For this analysis, you can use the *entire* dataset due to the small sample size we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of our features try to measure the similarity between two texts. Since our features are designed to measure similarity, it is expected that these features will be highly-correlated. Many classification models, for example a Naive Bayes classifier, rely on the assumption that features are *not* highly correlated; highly-correlated features may over-inflate the importance of a single feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you'll want to choose your features based on which pairings have the lowest correlation. These correlation values range between 0 and 1; from low to high correlation, and are displayed in a [correlation matrix](https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-correlation-matrix/), below."

If you cannot find features that are less correlated than some cutoff value, it is suggested that you increase the number of features (longer n-grams) to choose from or use *only one or two* features in your final model to avoid introducing highly-correlated features.\n",
